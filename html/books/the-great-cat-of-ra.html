                <h2>The Great Cat of R&#8217;a</h2>
                <span>Released August 3, 2016</span>
                <p>Shesmu, the hero of The Two Kites, has inherited his mentor Nekhen's French Restaurant in the city of Menmenet. The Montupahapy Society, the premier food industry association, awards him the prestigious Best Young Pezu award
                    after just a few months of work. Celebrating with his girlfriend, Detective-Sergeant Cheryl MacIntyre of the Menment Medjayu, he meets the officers of the Society, but the evening ends in disaster as one of them, Sen-Nedjem,
                    assaults another guest and gets bounced from the nightclub, and the wer of the Society, Nes-Imen, asks for his help in dealing with deeper issues at the Society. Over the next few days, Shesmu gradually discovers that many things
                    are not what they appear to be in Menmenet as he gets sucked into the Society's affairs and into MacIntyre's current case of a murder of a w'ab priest of Bastet by another w'ab priest. Following the money leads Shesmu and
                    MacIntyre into the dark world of the Russian mafias of Russkaya Amerika, the part of Russia to the north of Menmenet on the North American west coast, then back to Menmenet. The consequences are dire and force Shesmu into a very
                    different understanding of his own self-deception about his new life and his mentor; they also lead MacIntyre into mistaken trust and life-threatening situations she did not expect from a simple murder investigation. The second
                    novel in the alternative-history Menmenet series, The Great Cat of R'a explores the nature and consequences of self-deception in a very different world from our own.</p>

                    <p>
                        I stumbled into writing through technical documentation. I had just discovered the work of Robert B. Parker, the great detective
                        novelist, and I wondered: could I write a detective story that helped somebody learn how to use regular expressions? It turned out
                        I could, and that article was very popular. Years later, I had the opportunity to ghostwrite a technology book that conveyed
                        database management system technology through a story about a nineteenth century farm ledger, which was a best seller. Why not
                        inject technology into fiction?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, I developed many interests: science, technology, mathematics, ancient and modern history, archaeology, cooking,
                        psychology, and classical literature. So many great writers, so many excellent books! I use the encyclopedia of knowledge I acquired
                        over those many years to inform my fiction, written in the mystery, historical, and science fiction genres. I create alternate
                        histories that upend the assumptions we make about our own history. I use language (ancient Egyptian and its hieroglyphs, slave
                        dialect, and so on) to take people out of their own world and into somebody else's' world. I use historical characters to explore
                        both their moral character and their actual role in history, writing about themes like civil rights, political compromise, public
                        and moral duty, and slavery. I use science and technology to inject reality into mysteries, thrillers, and science fiction, both
                        to inform the reader on the subject and to show how the science and technology affects the world in which we live, or in which we
                        could live.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered Jane Austen in graduate school and learned that a fine brush is often better than a huge canvas at conveying the
                        relationships between people and the world in which they live. How the world works, how people construct it, how people live and
                        die in it, and why they live the kinds of lives they do.
                    </p>

                        I live and work in San Francisco with my wife and illustrator, Mary L. Swanson.
