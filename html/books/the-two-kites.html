                <h2>The Two Kites</h2>
                <span>Released Nov 19, 2012</span>
                <p>What would San Francisco life be like if the ancient Egyptian empire survived into the modern era and colonized the New World instead of the Spanish?</p>
                <p>Shesmu, the chef of a popular restaurant in the City of Menmenet, is in love with Neferaset, the wife of his mentor, Nekhen, who has been found with his throat cut in his kitchen. The medjays suspect she killed him, and Shesmu
                    is on the hook to prove she didn't. In the subsequent odyssey of self discovery, Shesmu finds the killer but also finds that ma'at, justice, often is more difficult than just discovering the truth: sometimes you have to create the
                    truth to find it. The Two Kites, an alternative history mystery novel, takes the reader to a very different kind of San Francisco while it explores the characters and culture that inhabit that city.</p>

                    <p>
                    I stumbled into writing through technical documentation. I had just discovered the work of Robert B. Parker, the great detective
                    novelist, and I wondered: could I write a detective story that helped somebody learn how to use regular expressions? It turned out
                    I could, and that article was very popular. Years later, I had the opportunity to ghostwrite a technology book that conveyed
                    database management system technology through a story about a nineteenth century farm ledger, which was a best seller. Why not
                    inject technology into fiction?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Over the years, I developed many interests: science, technology, mathematics, ancient and modern history, archaeology, cooking,
                    psychology, and classical literature. So many great writers, so many excellent books! I use the encyclopedia of knowledge I acquired
                    over those many years to inform my fiction, written in the mystery, historical, and science fiction genres. I create alternate
                    histories that upend the assumptions we make about our own history. I use language (ancient Egyptian and its hieroglyphs, slave
                    dialect, and so on) to take people out of their own world and into somebody else's' world. I use historical characters to explore
                    both their moral character and their actual role in history, writing about themes like civil rights, political compromise, public
                    and moral duty, and slavery. I use science and technology to inject reality into mysteries, thrillers, and science fiction, both
                    to inform the reader on the subject and to show how the science and technology affects the world in which we live, or in which we
                    could live.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I discovered Jane Austen in graduate school and learned that a fine brush is often better than a huge canvas at conveying the
                    relationships between people and the world in which they live. How the world works, how people construct it, how people live and
                    die in it, and why they live the kinds of lives they do.
                    </p>

                    I live and work in San Francisco with my wife and illustrator, Mary L. Swanson.
